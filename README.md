# Building in Public

I'm trying to document this project via my youtube channel [https://www.youtube.com/c/webdevjunkie](https://www.youtube.com/c/webdevjunkie) on this specific youtube series found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBUHBrYB_bQ&list=PL6x5Q-Sj_BlYlBoxMa_jo7LO3OSUhhbru&index=1](https://bit.ly/minecraftvlogseries).

# Getting Started

This project is broken up into 3 main components: agent, api, and client.  Each component has it's own package.json and will need to be setup and install individually.  To get started, do the following:

- client: `cd client && npm i && npm start` 
- server: `cd server && npm i && npm start` 
- agent: `cd agent && npm i && npm start` 

You will need the following installed in order for the agent to be able to run the minecraft servers and accept commands:

- docker (used for wrapping and hosting the minecraft server)
- socat (used for communicating via stdin to the running docker container)

# Flows

Below are the various high level architecture flows that occur in our system, such as when someone rents a server, or when someone sends a command to the MC Docker container.
